# Chess

This is a Chess application that I created as my first individual project.

Project Description:

This application is a true chess game which features highlighting the possible actions of a selected piece,
built-in timers and a surrender button that allows you to finish the game any time you need to. Players can also select the time limit for each game.
After each game players can reset the board and play again, change the timers or just exit the application.

Technologies used:

Java
